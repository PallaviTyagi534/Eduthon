A github repository for the  eduthon.
OVERVIEW
As we navigate through the difficult times of the CoVid-19 pandemic,there is a growing awareness of the importance in taking care of our mental health.With the inability to physically interact with friends and families or the stress of those directly 
interacted by the economic downfall,isolation and lockdown continue to exacerbate the mental health crisis.
One simple yet important thing to do is to stay connected with yourself and open up about your mental state.Journaling through technology is a healthy way to release emotional baggage and negativity,and can help people take care of their mental health during this isolation period.
In order to do so we want to create an app that encourages users to start journaling today.We think that journaling online to open up about our emotional baggage is an important step in taking care of our mental health.
